# AI Marketplace Listing Agent 🤖

An intelligent system that automates the entire process of selling items online. Simply upload a photo, and the AI agent handles image analysis, pricing validation, content creation, and marketplace publishing.

## 🎯 What It Does

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AI can't identify brand/model**
```bash
Solution: Add hints with known information
Check: Are brand logos visible in photo?
Try: Different photo angles or better lighting
```

**Price seems incorrect**
```bash
Check: Market position indicator and confidence scores
Consider: Seasonal/regional factors in Norwegian market
Review: FINN.no search results manually for comparison
```

**Description needs adjustment**
```bash
Use: Preview as a starting point for manual editing
Remember: AI excels at structure, you add personal touches
Best: Combine AI efficiency with human insight
```

**Schema validation errors**
```bash
Check: Zod schema limits in marketplace-agent.ts
Common: selling_points array exceeding max limit
Fix: Adjust schema constraints or prompt guidance
```
