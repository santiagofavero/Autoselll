Why Autoselll
Autoselll aims to transform manual listing work into a fast, reliable, and market-aware process. The system absorbs a single photo and returns a ready-to-publish listing with model-specific details, price alignment to Norwegian market data, and platform-ready descriptions. The result is professional listings in minutes, not hours.

Core capabilities
- Image understanding: The system analyzes photos to identify item type, brand, model, and visible conditions.
- Brand and model detection: It recognizes specific models (for example, ‚ÄúiPhone 14 Pro‚Äù instead of a generic ‚Äúphone‚Äù).
- Market data integration: It validates pricing against current Norwegian market data using Finn.no and other relevant sources.
- Copy generation: It creates optimized, Norwegian-language descriptions tailored to each platform‚Äôs requirements.
- Publishing preparation: It formats content for multiple marketplaces and prepares for automated posting to supported destinations.

How it works
- Step 1: Take a photo
  - You capture a photo of the item. The system uses computer vision to infer key attributes.
- Step 2: Validate pricing
  - The agent cross-checks prices with Norwegian market data, prioritizing Finn.no for reference values, trends, and comparable items.
- Step 3: Create listing content
  - The AI crafts a description in Norwegian that emphasizes features, condition, and selling points. It adapts tone to the target platform.
- Step 4: Publish readiness
  - The system packages everything for posting to FINN.no and Facebook Marketplace, preserving platform constraints like character limits and formatting.

Supported items and use cases
- Electronics: phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, audio gear
- Furniture: sofas, tables, wardrobes, d√©cor items
- Fashion: bags, shoes, apparel, accessories
- Vehicles: bikes, scooters, cars (where applicable)
- Sports equipment: skis, boards, gym gear
- Household appliances: kitchen gadgets, small appliances
- Toys and hobby gear: games, tools, collectibles

What makes Autoselll unique
- Universal item support: It adapts to many product categories with minimal configuration.
- Precise model detection: It distinguishes exact models and configurations to improve credibility and search performance.
- Market-aware pricing: It anchors prices to current Norwegian data, reducing underpricing or overpricing.
- Copy that converts: It writes descriptions designed to maximize engagement and trust.
- Seamless publishing pipeline: It prepares listings for automated posting on popular platforms.

Pricing validation and market data
- Real-time price checks: The system fetches and analyzes current prices for similar items.
- Regional targeting: Price suggestions are tuned to Norwegian buyers and channel expectations.
- Dynamic adjustments: If market conditions shift, the agent can propose updated pricing or highlight items with strong demand.

User experience and tone
- Clear, concise Norwegian language
